# Shopping Demo - Laksh's Store

This project is a front-end Minimum Viable Product (MVP) created to demonstrate the core features of a modern, responsive e-commerce website for a local general store. It is built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a clean user interface and essential shopping functionalities without a back-end.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Dynamic Product & Category Display**: Products and categories are loaded dynamically from a JavaScript object.
* **Interactive Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to the cart, view the cart in a modal, update item quantities, and remove items.
* **Featured Products Section**: Highlights best-selling or promotional items on the homepage.
* **Simulated Checkout**: A multi-step checkout process that collects user details and confirms the order (note: no actual payment processing).
